# Visualization of Egocentric Network using networkx library

### Egocentric Network ###

 Egocentric network is a very popular concept in Social Network Analysis(SNA). A particular egocentric network is defined by the degree up to which it is extended. Say, 1 degree egocentric network of a particular node in a graph is a subgraph consisting of all the nodes directly connected to it along with the direct edges. Similarly degree 2 egocentric network of a particular node in a graph is the subgraph that contains all the nodes that can be reached to it by a maximum of 2 edges.
